3 # DESCRIPTION
'''
Here are some important formulas used in mechanical engineering for fluid mechanics:

Bernoulli's Equation:
P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant,
where P is the pressure, ρ is the density of the fluid, v is the velocity of the fluid, 
g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height above a reference point.


Reynolds Number:
Re = ρVD/μ, where Re is the Reynolds number, ρ is the density of the fluid,
V is the velocity of the fluid, D is the characteristic length, and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.
Poiseuille's Law: Q = (π/8)h(r^4)/ηL, where Q is the volumetric flow rate, h is the pressure gradient, r is the radius of the pipe,
η is the dynamic viscosity, and L is the length of the pipe.
Darcy-Weisbach Equation: ΔP = f (L/D) (V^2/2g), where ΔP is the pressure drop, f is the Darcy friction factor,
L is the length of the pipe, D is the diameter of the pipe, V is the velocity of the fluid, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
